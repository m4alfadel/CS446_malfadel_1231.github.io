						SE2: Software Design and Architecture is the second course of the three software engineering capstone project courses, offered jointly by the <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/">David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science</a> and the <a href="http://ece.uwaterloo.ca">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Class will be in-person at MC 2038 10:00-11:20MW or 11:30-12:50MW unless the university decides to move to virtual. If we go virtual, at the same times we will meet in a zoom room whose link I will email all of you.
						<br>
						This will be a flipped classroom. I will post slides with scripts and the corresponding video recordings on Learn at least one day before class. I will strive to get them on earlier. 
						<br>
						In class we will do exercises and group discussions. Note that these are not evaluated. You are welcome and encouraged to attend as they will certainly make the material covered in the slides and recordings more concrete and meaningful. But you are not required to. 
						<br>

				<h2><a name="project" id="project"></a>Project</h2>
					<div class="sub">
						<p>
							The project forms an integral part of this course. Here are some of the hard requirements:
							 <ul>
							 	<li> 
							 		The app should be implemented as a Native Android app (i.e., not built using an app builder or a framework like React/Node.js or HTML5). 
							 	</li>
							 	<li> 
							 		The code should be hosted in Github as a private repository. You can choose to open source it after the class if you want. But during the time of the class it shall be private. You will need to add an external user as a collaborator with full privileges (TBD). This is github account for the instructor and TA. 						</li>
							 	<li>
									The app should use at least 2 architectural styles and 2 design patterns (other than singleton) that have been discussed in class.
							 	</li>
							</ul>					 
						</p>
						<p>		
							The three goals of the project is to 
							<ul>
								<li>produce a significant mobile app that performs some <b>useful</b> function </li>
								<li>does not cause harm to any population of users</li>
								<li>have a defensible design and architecture that can be presented to us explicitly</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>	
							When coming up with your own app there are only three soft restrictions on the app idea itself: no database management apps will be accepted (e.g., simple CRUD apps that do not make sense in a mobile context); apps that require crowd buy-in are not acceptable (e.g., apps that would require large numbers of people to contribute content to be viably useful); apps that require a complex server infrastructure are also not acceptable. If your app has any of these components, then you are responsible to have the DB or server infrastructure or crowd set up so that you can demo the app and we can test it too. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						If you are unable to come up with an idea, don't worry. We are working with an open source product team to set up an idea for you. This is an app that has social good built into it. This will be the default app that several teams can build at the same time in parallel. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If after the proposal, we feel that the app idea is too simple or too easy, then you will need to change to our default app idea above. The teams will then have to implement our suggested idea. See below for some great ideas from the past. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Human values</b>: In the proposal, you will detail the functional requirements, non-functional properties, and human values that your app addresses. You will also state who some of your stakeholders are and which population of users that your app is useful for. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Buddy team evaluation</b>: You will receive the proposal of another team. Your goal is to look at the proposal and find out which populations could be harmed and what harm could be created by the features of the app. You are expected to think critically and come up with an exhaustive list. The instructor and TAs will also come up with a list. You are evaluated on how similar you are to our list. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Pivot</b>: The lists of harm that exist in the app created by the instructor team and the buddy team will be shared with the team that proposed the project by the prototype demo stage. When you receive your list, you are expected to make changes in the project so that the harm is mitigated. This change has to be documented by the final demo and written deliverable. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The projects will be completed in teams of six. If it has less than six or more than six, you will need to explicitly get permission from the instructor.  You should select your own team; if you do not have a team or your team has less than six members, please post on Piazza. 
						</p>
						<p>
							All project grades taken together (D1, D2, D3, D6, D7) need not be the same for all team members. Each team member will get a score based on effort. Please only commit your personal contribution to the repository. Do not commit for another team member. Commits to the repo are an important signal to us. Additionally, projects will have a difficulty scale applied to them by the instructor and TAs. The scale formula will be: <pre>(total score for the team member across all project deliverables D1, D2, D3, D6, D7 + bonus) * (scale/100) = final project grade</pre> Scale will range between 0 and 100. The components of the scaling mark will be determined by:
						<ul>
							<li>10: completeness (compared to proposal)</li>	
							<li>10: utility</li>
							<li>10: polish</li>
							<li>10: difficulty</li>
							<li>10: pivot</li>
							<li>50: individual effort - will be based on peer evaluation and our assessment based on github logs</li>
						</ul>
						
						There will also be three sources of bonus marks during the term; which will be worth 2%:
						<ul>
							<li>Best prototype demo - To two teams</li>					
							<li>Best final demo - To two teams</li>
							<li>Accepted to the Google Play Store - To any team that gets through</li>																				
						</ul>
						
						<b>NOTE:</b> The expectation is that you will work approximately 9 hours per week on this course; at least 6 of these hours should be on the project. Given that the course lasts 12 weeks, each team member is expected to work on the project <i>at least</i> 75 hours. As a team of six that will be 450 hours. You should be able to accomplish something pretty great in this time; please make the most of this opportunity.

						<a name="install" id="install"></a><h4>Installing Android Studio</h4>
						<p><a href = "https://developer.android.com/studio/install">https://developer.android.com/studio/install</a>				
						</p>
						<p>
							Use the above link to start installing Android Studio in Linux/Win/Mac Machines beforehand. The download size may vary based on the operating system/region and locale ( 800 MB ) for Android Studio alone. Always choose the latest version of Android Studio and corresponding Gradle plugin to build APK files, which helps in reviewing code and evaluation.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>SDK Installation:</b> Use the latest Stable Android Version for SDK Compilation rather than the beta version. The preferable version can be from Android M ( API 23 ) to Android R ( API 30 ). As soon as you install the Android Studio, start selecting the preferred android version ( at least 1 ) and download the corresponding emulator, SDK Library, SDK Build Tools, and other utilities. Kindly allocate around 20 GB physical space for Android Studio and SDK Installation and a stable internet connection to complete all the installation setup in advance.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Emulator vs. Android Phone:</b> Kindly use Android Mobile phone for testing by connecting it via USB for debugging, which will have a low impact on system resources while building Android apps. Otherwise, kindly install x86 Google Play/Google API Supported Android emulator for instant access and testing. Do not install ARM or other arch types that are not optimized for cold startup/booting.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Reliable Network Connection:</b> Kindly ensure about reliable network connection for downloading Android Studio and SDK Libraries. Additional data will be required while using third party libraries to build an application or while syncing via Gradle.
						</p>

					<!-- <h2><a name="gradProject" id="gradProject"></a>Graduate Student Project</h2>
					<div class="sub">
						<p>
						For graduate students only: in addition to the project and other assessments above, you will perform an individual graduate project. The graduate project is worth 25% of your grade; your final grade will be calculated by scaling down the above assessments from 100% to 75%.
						</p>
						<p>
							Three types of graduate projects are possible:
								<ol>
									<li><b>Build a Software Tool:</b>
										<p>The goal of this style of project is to identify some problem developers encounter in practice, find some solution, and validate that the solution helps with the initial problem. I would recommend drawing upon your experience as you write code to identify some problem that has inhibited you in the past and fix it. 
										</p>
										<p>The outcome of this project will be a short (5-6 page) paper describing the problem, your solution, a comparison to related approaches, and some form of validation.</p>
									</li>
									<li><b>Literature Survey:</b>
										<p>
											The goal of this kind of project is to gain a more complete understanding of a topic relevant to this course. The outcome of this project will be a critical summary of the state-of-the-art on your selected topic; this summary should be 8-10 pages. It is essential that this summary synthesizes the surveyed literature to identify important themes, findings, and open questions.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li><b>Use an Advanced Software Development Tool</b>
										<p>
											The goal of this project is to provide a validation of some previously-existing development tool from the research community. The tool you validate must be related to the course material. The outcome of this project will be a 6-8 page paper describing your experience with the tool outlining its strengths, weaknesses, and avenues for future improvement.
										</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								There are two deliverables for the graduate project:
								<ol>
									<li><b>Project proposal.</b> Before you undertake your project you will need to submit a proposal for approval. The proposal should be short (1-2 pages in ACM format). The proposal should include a problem statement, the motivation for the project, a set of objectives you aim to accomplish, and a set of milestones. I will read these and provide comments. The proposal is not for marks but <b>must</b> be completed in order to pass the course. This will be due on May 31 via email to me. </li>
									<li><b>Written report.</b> The required length of the written report varies from project to project; all reports must be formatted according to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM format</a> and submitted as a PDF. This artifact will constitute 100% of the graduate project grade. This will be due on Aug 02 via email to me.
									</li>
